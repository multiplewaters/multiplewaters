## Heiyo! I am Richmond a.k.a multiplewaters or multiple waters
I am a self-taught graphic designer 🎨 with a little unconventional style.😜 Currently, I spend a large part of my time creating unique mouse cursors for desktop. 💻
All works are original creations by me. My works are not allowed to be sold, used, uploaded, re-uploaded, modified, distributed without my explicit permission.
I verify that this GitHub page, my website and my official pages on DeviantArt, Ko-fi, Buy Me A Coffee and any other page I will officially enlist are the only authorized channels for my work. I do not authorize any third-party redistribution. Any site hosting my 'Premium' or 'Special Edition' packs is doing so without a license and is in violation of copyright law.
